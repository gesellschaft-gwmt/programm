    <h2>Multiple Forms of Care. The Life and Afterlife of the Chimpanzee Mafuka in Dresden</h2>
    <p>Like many non-human primates that were brought to Europe from Africa or Asia during the long 19th century, the
        chimpanzee Mafuka, who lived at the Dresden Zoological Garden between 1873 and 1875, was assigned to very
        different roles: she was a (travelling) companion, zoo animal, capital, model, research and museum object.
        Numerous human and non-human actors were involved in these stages and transformation processes. These processes
        were also negotiated in different spaces. The keeping and research of non-human primates as supposed borderline
        beings between humans and animals opened up debates on evolutionary biology, behavioural psychology, educational
        science and racism, which were violently tested on Mafuka's body. This violence was mostly justified as care and
        thus legitimised. But which role of the chimpanzee, whether alive or dead, required which form of care? How did
        the tension between violence and care manifest itself and how was it perceived? And what agency was given to the
        chimpanzee in the care she received?
