    <h3>Ina Heumann (Museum für Naturkunde Berlin):</h3>
    <h2>Looting. A political epistemology of collecting in natural history</h2>
    <p>European and non-European wars are reflected in natural history collections in many ways. Parts of the
        collections themselves originate from theatres of war and can be traced back to military actors: mammals from
        colonial 'punitive expeditions', insects from the trenches of the First World War, birds shot by members of the
        Waffen-SS in Auschwitz, and destroyed collections bear eloquent witness to this.<br>Building on studies of
        ethnological, botanical, and ethnographic collecting that increasingly address the entanglements of collections,
        wars, and museums, I turn to the theatres of war in natural history to locate nature and natural history
        institutions as central sites of military violence and geopolitical interests. My paper examines the looting of
        an insect collection in Holland occupied by German troops, focusing on the justification strategies and
        consequences for the museum. Central to my analysis is the question of how far the exploitation of theatres of
        war for the hunting, looting and intellectual appropriation of animals can be described as a common practice of
        natural history collecting.
