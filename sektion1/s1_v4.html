    <h2>Reassembling a Broken Family Tree: Parental Cultures in Orangutans’ Display</h2>
    <p>Contemporary certified zoos often declare that wildlife extraction is no longer part of their trade. Yet the
        history of one orangutan dynasty reveals how animal cultural knowledge continues to erode as a lingering
        consequence of extraction—suggesting that "taking" represents a repetitive action rather than a past act.
        Studbook data, medical records, oral histories, and archival materials help reconstruct a familial biography
        illuminating the evolution of primate care practices. This paper shows how, from the forcible removal of
        forebears in Sumatra during the 1960s to the euthanasia of the youngest offspring in Zurich in 2023, keepers
        continuously deliberated over orangutans' existing knowledge about nursing their babies and grappled with what
        parental knowledge vanished in the transition to captivity. The issue of parental care reveals how zookeepers
        and institutional veterinarians speculated about orangutans' loss of maternal know-how. The question of
        parenthood—as emotion, instinct, and practice—marks moments of tension and convergence between the experiences
        and knowledge constituting care by both human keepers and captive orangutans. Some interventions in orangutan
        child-rearing manifested as institutional violence and disregard for mothers' learned knowledge, while other
        cases demonstrated profound zookeeper devotion and empathy.</p>
